        “BAYSGATE’s debut album turns synthetic voices into something heartbreakingly real.”
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite Riverwest diner what’s in the cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

    <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my Drive, that rule went out the window. I rolled my eyes at the “no pulse, all heart” tagline — pressed play anyway, and pretty soon caught myself sitting up straighter, adjusting my headphones, and actually starting to believe it.</p>

    <p>Before we ask if this is a <em>bona fide</em> album, let’s get real — every hit you’ve heard in the last decade has passed through a computer first. Auto-Tune, mastering plugins, stems stitched together at 3 a.m.; the line between human and machine got smudged years ago. BAYSGATE already had everything — the lyrics, the melodies, the production — the bones of it all. What they didn’t have was a voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do: opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic. Each voice was generated, tuned, and shaped through code — synthetic singers giving human songs their pulse.</p>

    <p><strong>Yeah. Every voice is artificial. And somehow, that’s what makes it feel so painfully human.</strong></p>

    <p>That’s the paradox BAYSGATE live in — code built to mimic feeling ends up out-feeling half the charts. And then the songs start proving it.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The record kicks off with <strong>“Shoes,”</strong> all jangly alt-pop warmth — American Hi-Fi with a crush. <strong>“Bad Girls Never Sleep”</strong> makes a sharp turn and slides neon-slick through the night like Charli XCX colliding with Garbage in a retrofitted DeLorean, while <strong>“Text STOP STACEY”</strong> turns modern romance into street-level anxiety — sharp, wry, and delivered with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot.</p>

    <p>When BAYSGATE lean soft, <strong>“The Backup Princess”</strong> flips the Disney formula on its jeweled head — a cracker-crown anthem with guitar grit and unapologetic grace. <strong>“Clara’s Dream”</strong> carries that Mazzy Star glow — slow, cinematic, and quietly devastating. <strong>“Lollipop”</strong> spins pure early-’60s bubblegum joy, while <strong>“Aurora Gory Alice”</strong> goes full heavy-prog rock — all thunderous fretwork and cosmic weight.</p>

    <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesn’t flex or apologize. It just stares you down and dares you to feel something inconvenient. While the rest of the industry keeps sanding the edges off emotion, BAYSGATE went ahead and built a collaboration of contradictions — messy, bold, and alive.</p>

    <p><strong>“Good Luck With That”</strong> struts with funk-pop payback, and <strong>“All About Her”</strong> explores a girl-girl crush glowing with genuine K-pop shimmer that <em>Hatsune Miku</em> would be proud of, before gliding into the haunted confessions of <strong>“Two Voices in the Kitchen,”</strong> and the demi-static ache of <strong>“Spillways”</strong> and <strong>“You Would Have Liked Her.”</strong></p>

    <p>And then there’s <strong>“Better Off as Zombies”</strong> — a funky jazz-pop side-eye at modern life, so self-aware it hurts. <strong>“Dying for Twenty”</strong> closes it out — quiet, merciless, and haunting.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.<br>
    <strong>But so are human emotions.</strong><br><br>
    And maybe that’s the point — machines don’t feel restraint either.</p>

    <p><br>So, was it a <em>bona fide</em> album after all? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But if emotion’s the metric — it’s as real as they come.<br><br>
