        “BAYSGATE’s debut album turns synthetic voices into something heartbreakingly real.”
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite Riverwest diner what’s in the cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

    <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my Drive, that rule went out the window. I rolled my eyes at the “no pulse, all heart” tagline — pressed play anyway, and pretty soon caught myself sitting up straighter, adjusting my headphones, and actually starting to believe it.</p>

    <p>Before we ask if this is a <em>bona fide</em> album, let’s get real — every hit you’ve heard in the last decade has passed through a computer first. Auto-Tune, mastering plugins, stems stitched together at 3 a.m.; the line between human and machine got smudged years ago. BAYSGATE already had everything — the lyrics, the melodies, the production — the bones of it all. What they didn’t have was a voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do: opened a laptop and let synthetic singers take the mic. Each voice was generated, tuned, and shaped through code — artificial throats giving human songs their pulse.</p>

    <p><strong>Yeah. Every voice is artificial. And somehow, that’s what makes it feel so painfully human.</strong></p>

    <p>That’s the paradox BAYSGATE live in — code built to mimic feeling ends up out-feeling half the charts. And then the songs start proving it.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The record kicks off with <strong>“Shoes,”</strong> all jangly alt-pop warmth — American Hi-Fi with a crush. <strong>“Bad Girls Never Sleep”</strong> slides neon-slick through the night like Charli XCX colliding with Garbage in a retrofitted DeLorean, while <strong>“Text STOP STACEY”</strong> turns modern romance into street-level anxiety — sharp, wry, and delivered with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot.</p>

    <p>When BAYSGATE lean soft, <strong>“The Backup Princess”</strong> flips the Disney formula on its jeweled head — a cracked-crown anthem with guitar grit and unapologetic grace. <strong>“Clara’s Dream”</strong> carries that Mazzy Star glow — slow, cinematic, quietly devastating. <strong>“Lollipop”</strong> spins pure early-’60s bubblegum joy; <strong>“Aurora Gory Alice”</strong> goes full heavy-prog rock — all thunderous fretwork and cosmic weight.</p>

    <p>Every song feels like its own little universe, stitched together more by emotion than genre.</p>

    <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesn’t flex or apologize. It just stares you down and dares you to feel something inconvenient. While the rest of the industry keeps sanding the edges off emotion, BAYSGATE built a collaboration of contradictions — messy, bold, alive.</p>

    <p><strong>Still, you can’t shake the sense that BAYSGATE sometimes mistake abundance for bravery.</strong> Twenty-nine songs leave nowhere to hide, but little room to breathe. It’s easy to be moved; harder to stay moved for nearly two hours. Somewhere between the clever lyrics and emotional circuitry, the album starts to feel like a flood when a storm would’ve done. It’s almost worth approaching this collection in two sittings — if only to give the latter half the justice it deserves.</p>

    <p><strong>“Good Luck With That”</strong> struts with funk-pop payback, and <strong>“All About Her”</strong> explores a girl-girl crush glowing with genuine K-pop shimmer that <em>Hatsune Miku</em> would be proud of, before gliding into the weary confessions of <strong>“Two Voices in the Kitchen,”</strong> and the demi-static ache of <strong>“Spillways”</strong> and <strong>“You Would Have Liked Her.”</strong></p>

    <p>Then there’s <strong>“Better Off as Zombies”</strong> — a jazzy, self-aware wink at modern life that hurts more than it should. <strong>“Dying for Twenty”</strong> closes it out — quiet, merciless, and haunting.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.<br>
    <strong>But so are human emotions.</strong><br><br>
    And maybe that’s the point — machines don’t feel restraint either.</p>

    <p><br>So, was it a <em>bona fide</em> album after all? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But if emotion’s the metric — it’s as real as they come.<br><br>
