    <article class="content">
      <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite Riverwest diner what’s in their cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

      <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my Drive, that rule kind of broke itself. The note mentioned AI vocals and human lyrics — basically, a duet between soul and software. The blurb called it “no pulse, all heart.” I assumed marketing. Then I listened — and realized it was underselling it. So I did the journalist thing: opened too many tabs, sharpened my skepticism, and tried to find the catch.</p>

      <p><strong>Spoiler: there wasn’t one.</strong></p>

      <p>Let’s be real — every song today passes through a computer. Auto-Tune, mastering plugins, stems stitched together at 3 a.m.; the human-machine line blurred long ago. The industry keeps warning AI will kill creativity. Maybe that day’s coming, but BAYSGATE clearly didn’t get the memo. And honestly? They’ve earned their pass.</p>

      <p>Everything was already there — lyrics, melodies, production, the bones and the blood. What they didn’t have was a voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do: opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic.</p>

      <p>Yeah. All of them were artificial. And somehow, it still feels heartbreakingly real.</p>

      <p>The vocals are smart — not because they’re perfect, but because they sound like they’re in on the secret. There’s a digital smirk in every take, and the lyrics do the rest — sharp, self-aware, unmistakably human. Twice I laughed out loud. Twice I felt personally attacked. And somewhere in there, I forgot it was code — too busy feeling something real.</p>

      <p>That’s the real trick of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em>: it’s not trying to deceive you — it’s daring you to feel something you didn’t plan to.</p>

      <p>The record kicks off with <em>Shoes</em>, a ’90s-alt pop hit that could’ve been written by American Hi-Fi’s younger cousin. <em>Bad Girls Never Sleep</em> snaps through a neon bassline like a Miley Cyrus video that got arrested for public indecency. <em>Running When Parked</em> bites with late-’80s edge; <em>Glitch</em> just sits in your Wi-Fi like a ghost humming to itself.</p>

      <p>Then BAYSGATE lean soft. <em>The Backup Princess</em> is Disney heartbreak with union dues, <em>Lollipop</em> spins early-’60s bubblegum into existential sugar, and <em>Text STOP STACY</em> nails modern romance with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot. <em>Aurora Gory Alice</em> builds a doomed space opera from prog-rock fragments, while <em>404: I Don’t Update Anymore</em> leaves a dumped AI stranded in digital purgatory.</p>

      <p><em>Good Luck With That</em> detonates into a funk breakdown like Bruno Mars crashing a Stevie Wonder session, and <em>All About Her</em> glows with genuine K-pop shimmer — partly in Japanese — before gliding into the hushed confessions of <em>Two Voices in the Kitchen</em> and the cinematic ache of <em>Spillways</em> and <em>You Would Have Liked Her.</em></p>

      <p>And then there’s <em>Better Off as Zombies</em> — a funky jazz-pop side-eye at modern life, so self-aware it hurts. It’ll date faster than an iPhone, but somehow still makes doomscrolling sound romantic.</p>

      <p><em>Dying for Twenty</em> closes it all — quiet, merciless, haunting.</p>

      <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesn’t flex. It doesn’t apologize. It just listens — and that’s somehow the most human thing of all. In an era where algorithms reward sameness, BAYSGATE built something messy and alive: a cathedral of contradictions.</p>

      <p>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.<br>Then again, so are emotions.<br>And BAYSGATE make every one count.</p>

      <p><strong>Streaming everywhere November 11.</strong><br><em>No score this time. Some things don’t fit the algorithm.</em></p>
