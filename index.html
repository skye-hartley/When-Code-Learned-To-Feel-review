    <p>I’ll be honest — I’m not the kind of person who sits around wondering how songs get made. Same way I don’t ask my favorite Riverwest diner what’s in the cheesecake that tastes like heartbreak and vanilla extract. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p>

    <p>But when a pre-release of <em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> landed in my Drive, that rule went out the window. I rolled my eyes at the “no pulse, all heart” tagline — pressed play anyway, and pretty soon caught myself sitting up straighter, adjusting my headphones, and starting to believe it.</p>

    <p>Let’s be real — every produced song today passes through a computer. Auto-Tune, mastering plugins, stems stitched together at 3 a.m.; the human–machine line blurred long ago. 
    And BAYSGATE was already there: lyrics, melodies, production, the bones and the blood. What they <em>didn’t</em> have — was a voice. So they did what any 2025 romantic would do — opened a laptop and invited AI vocalists to take a seat at the mic. 
    Each voice on the album was generated, tuned, and shaped through code — synthetic singers giving human songs their pulse. 
    Yeah. All of them were artificial. And somehow, it still feels heartbreakingly real.</p>

    <p>That’s the paradox BAYSGATE live in — code built to mimic feeling ends up out-feeling half the charts. And then the songs start proving it.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The record kicks off with <strong>“Shoes,”</strong> all jangly alt-pop warmth — American Hi-Fi with a crush, a best-friend breakup song disguised as comfort.</p>

    <p><strong>“Bad Girls Never Sleep”</strong> makes a sharp turn and slides neon-slick through the night like Charli XCX colliding with Garbage in a retrofitted DeLorean.</p>

    <p>Then there’s <strong>“Text STOP STACEY,”</strong> a sardonic anthem that turns modern romance into street-level anxiety — sharp, wry, and delivered with the precision of a passive-aggressive screenshot.</p>

    <p>And <strong>“404: I Don’t Update Anymore”?</strong> Likely the first song from the POV of a heartbroken AI — a glitch-ballad that makes error messages sound like poetry. <em>“My love had terms and conditions / Yours had multiple revisions.”</em> Perfect.</p>

    <p>When BAYSGATE lean soft, <strong>“The Backup Princess”</strong> flips the Disney formula on its jeweled head — a cracked-crown anthem with guitar grit and unapologetic grace. <strong>“Clara’s Dream”</strong> carries that Mazzy Star glow — slow, cinematic, and quietly devastating. <strong>“Lollipop”</strong> spins pure early-’60s bubblegum joy — Phil Spector sparkle. <strong>“Aurora Gory Alice”</strong> goes full heavy-prog rock — all thunderous fretwork and cosmic weight.</p>

    <p><strong>“Good Luck With That”</strong> struts with funk-pop payback, Bruno Mars style, and <strong>“All About Her”</strong> explores a girl-girl crush, glowing with genuine K-pop shimmer that <em>Hatsune Miku</em> would be proud of, before gliding into the hushed confessions of <strong>“Two Voices in the Kitchen,”</strong> and the cinematic ache of <strong>“Spillways”</strong> and <strong>“You Would Have Liked Her.”</strong></p>

    <p>And then there’s <strong>“Better Off as Zombies”</strong> — a funky jazz-pop side-eye at modern life, so self-aware it hurts. <strong>“Dying for Twenty”</strong> closes it out — quiet, merciless, and horribly haunting.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><em>When Code Learned to Feel</em> doesn’t flex or apologize. It just stares you down and dares you to feel something inconvenient. While the rest of the industry keeps sanding the edges off emotion, BAYSGATE went ahead and built a collaboration of contradictions — messy, loud, beautifully alive.</p>

    <p>Twenty-nine tracks is a lot.<br>
    <strong>But so are human emotions.</strong><br>
    And maybe that’s the point — machines don’t feel restraint either.</p>

    <p><strong>Streaming everywhere November 11</strong><br>
    <em>No score this time. You can’t algorithm your way to heartache.</em></p>
